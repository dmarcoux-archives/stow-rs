_stow-rs_ aims to be symlink farm manager akin to [GNU
Stow](https://github.com/aspiers/stow). I am not sure yet whether _stow-rs_ will
be a clone or an alternative to _GNU Stow_.

### Why?

While I find _GNU Stow_ extremely useful, I have [an
issue](https://github.com/aspiers/stow/issues/11#issuecomment-225536697) which I
want to address.

I normally contribute to projects whenever I can and have the time. I could do
it again, but _GNU Stow_ is written in _Perl_. I have nothing against _Perl_,
but I simply don't know this language nor want to learn it.

With this in mind, I am learning [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and I think
this is the perfect opportunity to apply what I learn while also doing something
fun and useful.
